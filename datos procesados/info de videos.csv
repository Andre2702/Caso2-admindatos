/videos/47985728,Sky Infotech : Java Programming Lessons,"Sky Infotech is a great institute. It teaches all type of IT Training courses one of which is Java. J2EE (Java 2 platform, Enterprise Edition) is a Java platform designed for the mainframe-scale computing typical of large enterprises. Sun Microsystems(Together with industry partners such as IBM) designed J2EE to simplify application development in thin client tiered environment. J2EE simplifies Application development and decreases the need for programming and Programmer training by creating standardized, reusable modular components and by enabling the tier to handle many aspects of programming automatically.",video,https://vimeo.com/47985728,604,640,,360,/videos?per_page=10&query=Java Programming&offset=6,/users/13054698,Sky Infotech,https://vimeo.com/skyinfotech,India,n
/videos/74701146,Functional Programming in Java: lambdas and beyond,"After a quick overview of the upcoming lambda expressions in Java8, the main purpose of this talk is to show, with practical examples, how to use them effectively and how they can help to develop more concise and readable code.

Finally also Java, with its 8th major release, will have lambda expressions and then will allow to employ some functional techniques into its strongly object oriented paradigm. But why this decision has been taken, what will be its consequences, how will it change the way we write Java and, most important, how can we leverage it to develop more expressive, readable, reusable and effective software? After a quick introduction to the syntax of the new lambda expressions, the main purpose of this talk is to answer these questions, showing how functional programming can make us better Java developer and help to avoid or limit some bad habits inherited from our OOP backgroud, like the abuse of side effects, null references and exceptions in our code.

Intended audience
Java developers who wants a preview on how lambda expressions will work in Java 8 and a few hints on how to use them effectively.",video,https://vimeo.com/74701146,3550,1280,,720,/videos?per_page=10&query=Java Programming&offset=7,/users/7540193,JavaZone,https://vimeo.com/javazone,Norway,n
